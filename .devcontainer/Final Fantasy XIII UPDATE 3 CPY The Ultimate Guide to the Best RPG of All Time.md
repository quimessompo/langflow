Final Fantasy XIII is a role-playing game developed and published by Square Enix in 2009. It is the thirteenth main installment in the Final Fantasy series and the first one to be released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles.

In 2014, Square Enix released a PC version of Final Fantasy XIII on Steam, which featured full screen support and 60 FPS gameplay. However, many fans were disappointed by the lack of graphical options, resolution settings, and controller support. To address these issues, Square Enix released three updates for the PC version, which improved the performance and added more features.
 
The latest update, Update 3 CPY, was released in 2019 by a group of hackers known as CPY. This update not only fixed some bugs and glitches, but also cracked the game's DRM protection, allowing players to play it without Steam. The update also included an optional fan-made Russian localization by FFRTT/ZoG Team, which replaced the English texts and GUI.

Final Fantasy XIII is not the only game that has been cracked by CPY. CPY is a notorious hacking group that has cracked many popular games that use DRM protection such as Denuvo, SecuROM, or Uplay. Some of their notable cracks include Assassin's Creed Origins, Far Cry 5, Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry 5, and FIFA 20. CPY releases their cracks on various torrent sites and forums, where they are praised by many gamers who appreciate their work.
 
However, cracking games is not a legal or ethical activity. It violates the intellectual property rights of the game developers and publishers, who spend a lot of time and money to create and distribute their games. It also deprives them of potential revenue and profits, which may affect their ability to make more games in the future. Cracking games may also expose your PC to malware or viruses that may harm your system or steal your personal information.
 
Therefore, if you want to play Final Fantasy XIII or any other game on PC, you should consider buying it from a legitimate source such as Steam or GOG. This way, you can support the game industry and enjoy a safe and legal gaming experience.
