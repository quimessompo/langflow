## Tips and Warnings
 
- Remember to re-enable the self-defense feature of your Kaspersky product after rebooting[^1^]. This will prevent unauthorized changes to its settings and ensure its optimal performance.
- Do not update your Kaspersky product while using KRT[^1^]. This may cause compatibility issues or errors with the trial reset process.
- Do not use KRT for commercial purposes or illegal activities[^1^]. This may violate the terms and conditions of Kaspersky products and result in legal consequences.
- KRT is not a crack or a keygen for Kaspersky products[^1^]. It does not modify or bypass the activation mechanism of Kaspersky products. It only resets the trial period of Kaspersky products so that you can use them for free.
- KRT is not a virus or malware[^1^]. It is a legitimate tool that has been tested and verified by many users and antivirus programs. However, some antivirus programs may detect it as a false positive or a potentially unwanted program (PUP). If this happens, you can add it to the exclusion list of your antivirus program or disable it temporarily while using KRT.
