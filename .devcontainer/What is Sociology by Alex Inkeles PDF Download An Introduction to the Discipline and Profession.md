In this article, we will review some of the main points and insights that Inkeles offers in his book *What is Sociology*. We will also highlight some of the strengths and limitations of his approach, and how it can be updated and supplemented by more recent developments and perspectives in sociology.
  
## The Subject Matter of Sociology
  
One of the first questions that Inkeles addresses in his book is: what is the subject matter of sociology? He defines sociology as "the scientific study of human social behavior" (p. 1). He argues that sociology is interested in understanding how human beings act and interact in various social contexts and situations, and how they shape and are shaped by the social structures and processes that surround them. He also claims that sociology is distinct from other social sciences, such as psychology, economics, political science, and anthropology, because it focuses on the social aspects of human behavior, rather than the individual, economic, political, or cultural aspects.

However, Inkeles also acknowledges that sociology is not a unified or homogeneous field, but rather a diverse and pluralistic one. He recognizes that there are different branches and subfields of sociology, such as urban sociology, rural sociology, industrial sociology, medical sociology, family sociology, and so on. He also admits that there are different schools and traditions of sociology, such as functionalism, conflict theory, symbolic interactionism, phenomenology, ethnomethodology, and so on. He suggests that these different approaches reflect the complexity and diversity of social reality, as well as the different interests and perspectives of sociologists.
  
While Inkeles provides a clear and concise definition of sociology and its subject matter, he also leaves room for debate and discussion. Some critics might argue that his definition is too broad or vague, and that it does not capture the specific features or contributions of sociology. Some might also challenge his distinction between sociology and other social sciences, and argue that there is more overlap and interdisciplinarity than he implies. Some might also question his classification of the different branches and schools of sociology, and argue that there are more or less categories than he suggests.
  
## The Sociological Perspective
  
Another important question that Inkeles addresses in his book is: what is the sociological perspective? He defines the sociological perspective as "a way of looking at human behavior that emphasizes its social character" (p. 18). He argues that the sociological perspective helps us to see beyond the obvious or common-sense explanations of human behavior, and to uncover the hidden or underlying patterns and causes of social phenomena. He also claims that the sociological perspective helps us to see beyond our own personal experiences or biases, and to appreciate the diversity and complexity of human societies.
  
Inkeles illustrates the sociological perspective by using various examples from everyday life. For instance, he shows how the sociological perspective can help us to understand why people behave differently in different situations or roles; why people conform to or deviate from social norms or expectations; why people cooperate or compete with each other; why people form groups or associations; why people have different beliefs or values; why people experience different problems or opportunities; why people change or resist change; and so on. He also shows how the sociological perspective can help us to compare and contrast different societies or cultures; to analyze the effects of social forces or factors on human behavior; to evaluate the advantages or disadvantages of different social arrangements or policies; to identify the sources or solutions of social problems or issues; and so on.
  
While Inkeles provides a useful and comprehensive overview of the sociological perspective and its applications, he also acknowledges its limitations and challenges. He recognizes that the sociological perspective is not a single or fixed one, but rather a flexible and dynamic one. He admits that there are different ways of applying the sociological perspective, depending on the purpose or context of inquiry. He also concedes that there are some difficulties or risks involved in using the sociological perspective, such as oversimplifying or overgeneralizing social phenomena; ignoring or neglecting individual differences or variations; imposing or projecting one's own values or assumptions; being biased or prejudiced by one's own social position or background; being influenced or manipulated by external pressures or interests; being detached or alienated from one's own society or culture; being pessimistic or cynical about human nature or society; being arrogant or dogmatic about one's own knowledge or perspective; being isolated or marginalized from other disciplines or professions; being irrelevant or impractical for real-world problems or issues; being criticized or rejected by other scholars or publics;
