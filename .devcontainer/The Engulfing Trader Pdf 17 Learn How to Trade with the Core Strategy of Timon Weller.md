## What is The Engulfing Trader Pdf 17?
 
The Engulfing Trader Pdf 17 is a digital product that consists of a PDF book and a series of videos that teach you how to trade the Forex market using engulfing candles. Engulfing candles are a type of candlestick pattern that indicate a reversal or continuation of the trend, depending on where they occur on the chart.
 
The PDF book covers the basics of drawing structure on the charts, identifying the candle signal at structure, taking the trade and managing your money. The videos go into more detail and show you examples of how to apply the strategy in different time frames and market conditions.
 
The strategy is based on the principle that the market moves in waves and respects certain levels of support and resistance. By trading with engulfing candles at these levels, you can capture high probability trades with a good risk-reward ratio.
 
## How does The Engulfing Trader Pdf 17 work?
 
The Engulfing Trader Pdf 17 works by following these steps:
 
1. Draw structure on the daily chart, using horizontal lines to mark the major and minor levels of support and resistance.
2. Switch to a lower time frame, such as the 4-hour or 1-hour chart, and look for engulfing candles that form at or near the structure levels.
3. Enter the trade in the direction of the engulfing candle, placing your stop loss below or above the candle (depending on whether it is bullish or bearish).
4. Set your target at the next level of structure or use a trailing stop to lock in profits.
5. Manage your risk by using a fixed percentage of your account per trade or a position sizing calculator.

The strategy can be used on any currency pair, but Timon Weller recommends focusing on the major pairs for better liquidity and lower spreads. He also advises trading during the London and New York sessions, when the market is more active and volatile.
