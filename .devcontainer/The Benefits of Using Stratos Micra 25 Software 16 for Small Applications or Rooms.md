# Stratos Micra 25: A High Sensitivity Smoke Detector with Software Integration
 
Fire detection is a crucial aspect of safety and security in any building or facility. However, conventional smoke detectors may not be able to provide the earliest warning of fire, especially in environments that require extremely high sensitivity or have difficult access for maintenance. That's why Kidde Products Ltd. has developed the Stratos Micra 25, a high sensitivity smoke detector that uses laser technology and software integration to offer superior performance and reliability.
 
## What is Stratos Micra 25?
 
Stratos Micra 25 is a single pipe aspirating smoke detector that can draw air from the protected area through a sampling pipe of up to 50m long[^1^]. It has a sensitivity scale ranging from 0.003 to 25% obs/m, which means it can detect smoke at very low concentrations[^2^]. It also has a removable filter cartridge that allows field serviceability even in the dirtiest of environments[^1^].

Stratos Micra 25 is equipped with an RS485 connector that allows the connection of several devices in a network[^1^]. It also comes with a PIPECAD software that helps design and configure the sampling pipe network[^1^]. Moreover, it can be integrated with the SenseNET software, which allows networks of Stratos detectors to be monitored centrally from a PC[^3^]. The SenseNET software can import graphical maps of the site for easy location of detectors, alarm zones, etc. It can also display real-time status, events, and trends of up to 16 Stratos detectors[^3^].
 
## What are the benefits of Stratos Micra 25?
 
Stratos Micra 25 offers several benefits over conventional smoke detectors, such as:
 
- It provides the very earliest warning of fire by using laser technology and artificial intelligence to discriminate smoke from nuisance particles[^1^].
- It reduces false alarms by self-calibrating and adjusting its sensitivity according to the environmental conditions[^1^].
- It is suitable for installation in small applications or rooms that require individual incipient fire reporting[^1^].
- It is easy to install and maintain by using a simple wiring scheme and a removable filter cartridge[^1^] [^2^].
- It is compatible with both conventional and analogue fire detection systems by using relay outputs[^1^].
- It can be networked and monitored remotely by using the RS485 connector and the SenseNET software[^1^] [^3^].
