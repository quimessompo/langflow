## What is Pipe Flow Expert 2013?
 
Pipe Flow Expert 2013 is a software program that calculates fluid flow in open or closed loop pipe networks with multiple supply and discharge tanks, multiple pumps in series or in parallel, and multiple pipe sizes and fittings. It can model both steady state and transient flow conditions, as well as compressible and incompressible fluids. It can also handle complex pipe layouts with loops, branches, tees, valves, components, and other fittings.
 
Pipe Flow Expert 2013 uses the Darcy-Weisbach formula to calculate pressure losses due to friction, and the Colebrook-White equation to calculate friction factors. It also uses an iterative method to solve the system of equations that describe the flow and pressure distribution in the network. Pipe Flow Expert 2013 can handle up to 1000 pipes in a single system, and it can solve systems with multiple unknowns, such as flow rates, pressures, pipe sizes, pump speeds, etc.
 
## What are the benefits of Pipe Flow Expert 2013?
 
Pipe Flow Expert 2013 has many benefits for engineers who need to design and analyze piping systems. Some of these benefits are:
 
- It has an intuitive user interface that is easy to use and best-in-class. You can draw your pipe system in an isometric 3D view with automatic symbol rotation, or use a schematic 2D view. You can also import and export data from Excel or CSV files.
- It has a robust calculation engine that can solve complex pipe networks quickly and accurately. You can view the results in tables, charts, or on the drawing itself. You can also generate customized PDF reports with your company logo and details.
- It has a fluid database with common liquid and gas data, a pipe database with common pipe materials and sizes, and a fittings database with common valve and fitting data. You can also add your own data or modify the existing ones.
- It has a pump modeling feature that can predict pump performance across a range of speeds and impeller sizes. You can also use a searchable pump database to select pumps from various manufacturers. You can also generate professional pump data sheets in PDF format.
- It has a tabbed design sheet feature that lets you work on multiple systems simultaneously. You can also copy and paste pipes, fittings, components, pumps, tanks, etc. between different systems.
- It has an enhanced edit grid feature that allows you to filter and mass update control valves, components, pumps, etc. You can also use formulas to define parameters such as flow rates, pressures, pipe lengths, etc.
