Renault True Code is a PC based software package that specialises in programming vehicle remotes, keys and cards, and reads the security pincodes on a selected range of Renault vehicles. The software communicates with the vehicle via the OBD socket, extracts and reveals the security pincode and enables keys and remotes to be cleared or added to the memory.
