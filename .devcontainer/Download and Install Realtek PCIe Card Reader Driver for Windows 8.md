## Step 1: Visit the Realtek website
 
The first step is to visit the Realtek website and find the download page for the card reader driver. You can use this link[^2^] to go directly to the card reader controllers software section. Alternatively, you can go to the homepage of Realtek[^3^] and click on "Downloads" at the top menu. Then, select "Card Reader Solutions" from the drop-down list and click on "Card Reader Controllers Software".
 
## Step 2: Choose the appropriate driver for your device
 
The next step is to choose the appropriate driver for your device. You need to know the model number of your Realtek PCIE card reader device and the version of Windows 8 that you are using (32-bit or 64-bit). You can check these information by following these steps:
 
- Right-click on "My Computer" or "This PC" icon on your desktop or in File Explorer and select "Properties".
- Under "System", look for "System type" and note whether it says "32-bit operating system" or "64-bit operating system".
- Under "Device Manager", expand the category of "Memory technology devices" or "SD host adapters" and look for your Realtek PCIE card reader device. Right-click on it and select "Properties".
- Under "Details", select "Hardware Ids" from the drop-down list and note the model number of your device. It should start with "RTS" followed by four digits.

Once you have these information, go back to the Realtek website and look for the driver that matches your device model number and Windows 8 version. For example, if you have a RTS5229 device and a 64-bit Windows 8 system, you should download the driver with file name "t1car9089us14cmp.exe" from this link[^1^]. The file size is 5.8 MB and the version is 10.0.10130.29089.
