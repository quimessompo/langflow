The eMMC Software Download App is a tool that works only for Qualcomm devices. It will not work for any other chipsets. So, make sure you have a Qualcomm device before using the tool. Also, flashing or installing firmware using the tool will wipe the data from the device. Therefore, we recommend you backup your important data from the device before using the tool.
 
The eMMC Software Download App is created and distributed by Foneric, Inc. So, full credit goes to them for sharing the application for free.
